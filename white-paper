PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT : 
The aim of computers is to take user inputs and transform those inputs into outputs. We long for a variety of transcoding mechanisms that transform text and audio into visual graphics. It is true that computers are good at memory. It is also true that computers are good at curation and transcoding of information.

MAINFRAME Computers

Optimised for encoding military publications
Operational computation not readily available

MOBILE Computers

Optimised for integrating content publications
Abstracts the computational process.

the 4Frame-Graphics-ENGINE
C/C MODEL

A conversation-cycle model

The object of the model is to:

FALSIFY: human conversation interest does not exceed two weeks.

SIMPLIFY:  computation of movement/traffic algorithms. 

REMOVE: loop / polling algorithms 
L/P MODEL

A legal-property model

The object of the model is to:

FALSIFY: copyrights are the most expensive assets.

SIMPLIFY: computation of value/security/danger.

REMOVE:  memory-intensive / recursive algorithms.  



R/L MODEL

A revenue-labour model

The object of the model is to:

FALSIFY: productivity is a function of labour capability.

SIMPLIFY:  computation of script/identity/urns.

REMOVE:  vector-based (2 dimensional) algorithms. 



L/C MODEL

A library-catalogue model

The object of the model is to:

FALSIFY: knowledge is a function of actions.

SIMPLIFY: computation of metamorphic growth/change.

REMOVE:  cpu-intensive / context-specific algorithms.

STATEMENT : 
Many similar architectures  subscribe to WebGL, ePub, WebAssembly and OTP/erlang to simplify code-search.
